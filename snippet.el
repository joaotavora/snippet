;;; Commentary:

;; The yasnippet snippet insertion and navigation engine, though very powerful,
;; is bloated and its implementation much contrived.
;;
;; snippet.el's main goal is to provide yasnippet and other snippet-managing
;; frontends with the bare minimum funcionality to define, insert, navigate and
;; undo snippets.
;;
;; Snippets are defined via the `define-dynamic-snippet' or
;; `define-static-snippet' entrypoints. The snippet definition syntax is quite
;; different (TODO: how so?). Static snippets have better syntax checks at
;; compile-time, but complex snippets may be easier to write as dynamic
;; snippets. Both are as powerful as yasnippet's, in turn inspired by
;; textmate's). There are also `with-dynamic-snippet' and `with-static-snippet'
;; macros to use in your own defuns.
;;
;; The snippet definitions defined with both macros `define-*-snippet' macros
;; can be `edebug'ed and stepped through on snippet insertion and
;; navigation. (TODO: for `define-dynamic-snippet', this works for forms in
;; snippet fields, but fails for mirrors for some reason.)
;;
;; Once inserted into a buffer, snippets are navigated using
;; `snippet-next-field' and `snippet-prev-field', bound to TAB and S-TAB by
;; default.
;;
;; Funcionality such as snippet management, mode management, tab-trigerring or
;; any other fanciness are *not* offered.  `define-snippet's PROPERTIES
;; mechanism *might* become extensible to provide frontends such as yasnippet
;; the capability to conveniently implement said fanciness.
;;
;; TODO: primary field transformations: the (&transform ...) option to &field
;;       constructs. In `define-dynamic-snippet', mirror forms should only be
;;       evaluated for value. &exit should be generalized to also allow nested
;;       fields.
;;       
;; TODO: auto-indentation of the inserted snippet
;;
;; TODO: there should be somewhere a PROPERTIES argument, unimplemented at time
;; of writing, in the `define-snippet' macro which should probably understand a
;; set of properties controlling snippet's indentation, custom keymapping and
;; other per-snippet characteristics affecting snippet.el's core functionality.
;; 
;; TODO: undo, specifically snippet revival
;;
;; TODO: more documentation
;;
;; TODO: (&exit ...) constructs with a default string should leave it marked and
;;       highlighted in the buffer on snippet-exit.  Yasnippet tried, but does
;;       not support this correctly.
;;
;; TODO: stacked insertion, aka snippet-in-snippet: the ability to expand a
;;       second snippet while navigating a snippet's field, and returning to the
;;       original field after exiting the second snippet.
;;
;; TODO: sub-snippets: the ability to insert navigable sub-snippets into a
;;       snippet definition by chaining them to the adjoining objects.  Yasnippet
;;       does not provide this.  Might become a (&snippet ...) construct to
;;       `define-snippet'.
;;
;; TODO: dynamic fields: the ability dinamically add snippet fields and mirrors
;;       to the snippet currently being navigated.  Yasnippet does not provide
;;       this and seems hard to do.  Might become obsolete if stacked insertion
;;       and primary field transformations are implemented nicely.

  "Define NAME as an interactive snippet-inserting function.

Each form in SNIPPET-FORMS, inserted at point in order, can be:

* A cons (&field [FIELD-NAME [FIELD-DEFAULT]]) definining a snippet
  field. Snippet fields can be edited and be navigated to using
  `snippet-next-field' and `snippet-prev-field'. FIELD-NAME is
  optional and used for referring to the field in mirror
  transforms.

  FIELD-DEFAULT is optional and determines the field's starting
  text. It can be any lisp form returning a string or have be a cons
  (&transform FIELD-TRANSFORM) where FIELD-TRANSFORM is again a
  lisp form returning a string. Choosing between these varieties
  defines when and how these forms are evaluated. See below for
  details.

  FIELD-DEFAULT can also be a cons (&nested SUB-FORMS) where each
  form in SUB-FORMS is evaluated recursively according to the
  rules of SNIPPET-FORMS, thus producing nested fields and
  mirrors.

* A cons (&mirror FIELD-NAME [MIRROR-TRANSFORM]) defining a mirror
  of the field named FIELD-NAME. MIRROR-TRANSFORM is an optional
  form producing a string that becomes the mirror text. If it is
  not provided the mirror's text always matches FIELD-NAME's.

* Any lisp form producing a string, call it CONSTANT, that is a
  part of the snippet but constant while the snippet is alive.

* A cons (&exit [EXIT-DEFAULT]), defining a special field within
  the snippet where point should be placed when the snippet is
  exited normally. EXIT-DEFAULT has the same semantics as
  FIELD-DEFAULT.

The forms CONSTANT, FIELD-DEFAULT, MIRROR-TRANSFORM,
FIELD-TRANSFORM and EXIT-DEFAULT are all evaluated at
snippet-insertion-time and with the variable `region-string' set
to the text of the buffer selected at snippet-insertion time. If
no region was active the value of this variable is the empty
string.

The forms MIRROR-TRANSFORM and FIELD-TRANSFORM are additionally
also evaluated each time the field is changed. Moreover,
FIELD-TRANSFORM is also evaluated when the field is entered or
left. These forms are evaluated with the following variables set:

* `field-string' is set to the text contained in the field;
* `field-left' is non-nil if the field is being left;
* `field-entered' is non-nil if the field is being entered;
* `field-modified-p' is non-nil if the field has ever been modified
  since snippet creation

If the form CONSTANT returns nil or the empty string, it is
considered to have returned a single whitespace.

If FIELD-TRANSFORM returns a string, it replaces the fields text,
either at snippet-insertion-time or when the field is being
edited, entered or left. If FIELD-TRANSFORM returns nil at
snippet-insertion-time, it is considered to have returned the
empty string. If it returns nil on any other occasion, the field
is left unchanged.

If any other form returns nil, it is considered to have returned
the empty string.

PROPERTIES is an even-numbered property list of (KEY VAL)
pairs. Its meaning is not decided yet"

(defmacro define-dynamic-snippet (name args &optional docstring &rest body)
  "Define NAME as a snippet-inserting function.

Inside BODY the following local macros are available to
create snippet fields and mirrors:

* (&field NAME [FIELD-BODY]) declares the start of a snippet
  field at point. Snippet fields can be edited and be navigated
  to using `snippet-next-field' and
  `snippet-prev-field'. FIELD-BODY is a list of lisp forms which
  are evaluted for both return value and side-effects: Any text
  inserted becomes the field's starting text. If a string is
  returned, it is also inserted at the end of the field. Since
  FIELD-BODY is evaluated according to the rules of BODY, nested
  mirrors and fields become possible. Alternatively, FIELD-BODY
  can also be a single form, a cons (&transform
  FIELD-TRANSFORM-ARGS FIELD-TRANSFORM). See below for details.

* (&mirror FIELD-NAME [MIRROR-TRANSFORM-ARGS MIRROR-TRANSFORM])
  declares the start of a mirror at point. If
  MIRROR-TRANSFORM-ARGS and MIRROR-TRANSFORM are ommited the
  mirror's text always matches FIELD-NAME'S. If provided,
  MIRROR-TRANSFORM-ARGS is a list of 0 to 4 symbols that are
  automatically bound to values extracted from the snippet field
  FIELD-NAME and that can be used by the single form
  MIRROR-TRANSFORM to produce the mirror's text. The values
  passed in are, in order:

  * a string containing the field's text;
  * a boolean indicating if the field has just been entered;
  * a boolean indicating if the field has just been left;
  * a boolean indicating if the field has ever been modified since
    insertion

  MIRROR-TRANSFORM can also refer to any lexically available
  symbols established in by other forms in BODY.

* (&exit [EXIT-BODY]) declares a special field special within the
  snippet where point should be placed when the snippet is exited
  normally. EXIT-BODY has the same semantics as FIELD-BODY.

Except for these special cases, forms in BODY are evaluated
normally. If at least one snippet field was declared, a navigable
snippet is inserted at the end.

MIRROR-TRANSFORM is evaluated at snippet-insertion time and each
time the corresponding field changes to produce the mirror's
text. If it returns nil, it is considered to have returned the
empty string.

If FIELD-BODY has the form (&transform FIELD-TRANSFORM-ARGS
FIELD-TRANSFORM), FIELD-TRANSFORM is passed the same parameters
as MIRROR-TRANSFORM, except that at snippet-insertion time, the
value of the first parameter to FIELD-TRANSFORM-ARGS is nil. At
snippet-insertion time the field's starting text should be
produced. If it returns nil, it is considered to have returned
the empty string.

FIELD-TRANSFORM is also called every time the field is edited or
when it is entered or left. It may then return a string replacing
the field's text or return nil to leave it unchanged. If the
field is changed in this manner, any corresponding mirror's
MIRROR-TRANSFORMS are also evaluated at the time."
